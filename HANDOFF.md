# 10 November 2026, late: S0 started, the seed is in (branch `s0-seed`)

- **Seeded from FART-next tag `FARG`** (`c13d874`): code at the root, FART's docs in `docs/fart/`, its NOTICE as `licenses/FART-NOTICE`. NOTICE records it.
- **`zaetherion` launcher** (`./zaetherion`, `tools/zaetherion.py`): FART's CLI with its own runtime, state and cache folders (`zaetherion`), so it can't touch the everyday `fart`. Checked with `status` only; not started. Still named fart-next in help text and the core's own names.
- `test_orbit` passes from the seeded tree. The full suite hasn't run here yet.
- **OPEN 2 checked (read-only):** tesseract, zbarimg and satty are all installed.
- **Still S0, waiting on the owner:** OPEN 13 (keep the heavy layer and change the "dGPU never woken" budget, or move it to the AMD chip); the first `dms run` for the fixtures; the quiet baseline. The FARG measurements are in FART's `docs/OVERDRIVE.md` §9: NVIDIA asleep in Silent and after release, about 38 % and 12–14 W while Overdrive is on.

# 10 November 2026: the plan says "bring FART over"; DMS installed

**State:** still design only, no shell code. Two things changed:
- **FART-next is past the start line (Z1).** It has built all of M0–M16, including what this plan had moved here (M13 lensing, M14's live previews, M15 discovery and the archive, M16's tiers), plus M11 sessions and the heavy layer on the NVIDIA card. **Z62 now says ZÆTHERION brings FART over:** all of it arrives with the S0 seed and is adapted, not rebuilt. S11 extends FART's Overdrive to the island, launcher, overview and lock card. MILESTONES, DECISIONS (Z1, Z9, Z62), DMS_BACKEND and README updated.
- **DMS is installed: `extra/dux-shell` 2.1.0-1** (the owner, 10 November, 14:18), not `dux-shell-git`. Z9 is changed to match. **Not run yet:** `dms.service` is disabled and inactive, and there's no DMS config directory.

**New open item:** OPEN.md 13, the heavy layer on the NVIDIA card against the "dGPU never woken" budget. The seed brings it in, so it needs the owner's answer at S0.

**Untouched:** `docs/ROADMAP.md` is an uncommitted local file from before this change; it still says `dux-shell-git` and "M13–M16 move here". Left as it is.

**Next task:** S0, when the owner says go:
1. Seed this repo from a tagged FART-next commit. FART-next first takes its 144 Hz measurements and finishes its optimisation pass, then tags.
2. Record and scrub the DMS fixtures (`dms run` for the first time, on the owner's go; check `apiVersion` against 2.1.0).
3. Read-only check for tesseract, zbarimg and satty (OPEN 2).
4. Measure the quiet baseline.

# 8 November 2026: planning complete, design docs published

**State:** design only. No shell code exists. The plan came from one long planning session in which the owner answered every design question: 142 decisions (Z1–Z142), plus 12 open items, each with the test or approval that settles it.

**Done:**
- The docs set: VISION, DECISIONS, SURFACES, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRACT, MILESTONES, BUDGETS, RISKS, PARITY, DMS_BACKEND and OPEN.
- A plain-language overview PDF for non-technical readers.
- The public GitHub repo, with milestones S0–S12 and issues.

**Not done, by design:**
- No package installed. DMS was researched from its source only.
- No Hyprland, SDDM or Serpantinum file touched.
- No FART-next code changed; a docs pointer branch exists there, unmerged.

**Next task:** wait. ZÆTHERION starts when the owner says FART-next's Overdrive has reached about M12. Then begin S0 (docs/MILESTONES.md):
1. Ask for approval to install `dux-shell-git`.
2. Seed this repo from a tagged FART-next commit.
3. Record and scrub the DMS fixtures.
4. Measure the quiet baseline.
